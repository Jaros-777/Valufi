This is a demo web store based on React.js, SaaS and Supabase. It uses authentication and authorization, as well as saving the user's current session to LocalStorage for additional security.
Each user has the ability to search for products by phrases or categories entered. By clicking on a selected product, it is possible to see its details, available forms of delivery and the opinions of other users who have already made a purchase.
The user can create and manage an account, using functions such as logging out, changing the password or deleting the account. In addition, the user has the ability to add selected products to his or her shopping cart, and, after a demonstration of the order (without actual payment and purchase), to give feedback on the purchased items.
This store was created for demonstration purposes only, to showcase functionality and technical skills. It is not intended for commercial use due to the lack of configured payment systems.
